# DeepLabV3+ Model for Semantic Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of the DeepLabV3+ model adapted for semantic segmentation tasks, with specific enhancements suited for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imagery. The DeepLabV3+ model employs Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and a streamlined MobileNetV2 backbone to efficiently extract multi-scale contextual information.

## Overview

DeepLabV3+ builds upon the core DeepLabV3 architecture by adding a decoder module, which refines segmentation boundaries and improves spatial precision. This adaptation reduces the number of parameters and optimizes performance, making it suitable for real-time applications on high-resolution images.

**Note:** The UAV dataset utilized is proprietary and is not publicly accessible.

## Model Architecture

The DeepLabV3+ model leverages a lightweight architecture with the following components:

1. **Backbone**: The MobileNetV2 backbone is employed as a feature extractor, specifically utilizing the feature map from the `block_13_expand_relu` layer.
2. **ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling)**: Extracts multi-scale features using different dilation rates, capturing spatial information at varied resolutions.
3. **Low-Level Features**: Extracted from an earlier layer (`block_3_expand_relu`) of MobileNetV2 to aid in the fine-grained segmentation of boundaries.
4. **Decoder**: Refines segmentation masks by merging low-level features with ASPP features and applying additional convolutions.
5. **Output Layer**: Produces the segmentation map with a final 1x1 convolution and sigmoid activation for binary segmentation.

```python
# Model Instantiation
model = DeeplabV3Plus((IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH), NUM_CLASSES)
model.compile(optimizer='Adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## ASPP and MobileNetV2 Backbone

The ASPP module employs three distinct branches to capture spatial context:

- **1x1 Convolution**: Captures basic features with no dilation.
- **Dilated 3x3 Convolution**: Applies a dilation rate of 6, capturing broader context.
- **Global Average Pooling**: Completes the pyramid by applying global pooling followed by 1x1 convolution, resized to match feature maps.

MobileNetV2 offers a lightweight, efficient architecture that balances computational cost with effective feature extraction, making it ideal for UAV datasets with high spatial variance.

## Differences from the Original DeepLabV3+

The modifications in this adaptation of DeepLabV3+ include:

- **Filter Reductions**: The number of filters in ASPP and decoder blocks is reduced to streamline computation.
- **Custom Resize Layer**: A custom `ResizeLayer` dynamically resizes feature maps to match target sizes, optimizing the decoder path.
- **Reduced Dropout**: Dropout is minimized to enhance feature retention, as UAV data generally lacks the variability found in larger, more generalized datasets.
- **Mixed Precision Option**: This version supports mixed precision training to enhance speed and reduce memory usage.
- **Modified Backbone**: The MobileNetV2 backbone is utilized in place of the more complex Xception or ResNet backbones commonly seen in the original DeepLabV3+ model.

These changes preserve the core structure of DeepLabV3+ while optimizing the model for resource efficiency and real-time processing requirements.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation techniques are incorporated to improve generalization:

- **Rotation**: Introduces orientation variance.
- **Shifts**: Simulates translation across different viewpoints.
- **Zooming**: Varies scales for object size diversity.
- **Horizontal Flip**: Adds flipped images for enhanced variation.
- **Normalization**: Rescales pixel values to stabilize training.

This configuration of augmentations allows for comparative analysis with and without augmentation, providing insights into its effectiveness on UAV imagery.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained with callbacks that aid in performance monitoring:

- **ModelCheckpoint**: Preserves the best-performing model.
- **EarlyStopping**: Stops training when validation loss ceases to improve.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Decreases the learning rate progressively to enhance convergence.

**Metrics**:
- **Mean IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Assesses the overlap between prediction and ground truth.
- **Precision and F1 Score**: Provide additional insights into segmentation quality.

Training progress is visualized with metrics such as training and validation loss, as well as IoU for a comprehensive performance assessment. Evaluation includes prediction speed analysis and visual comparisons between ground truth and model predictions.

## Visualization

The model output can be visualized through prediction overlays, comparing segmentations against ground truth labels. This helps in inspecting model performance on complex scenes, particularly for verifying boundary accuracy and spatial coherence.
